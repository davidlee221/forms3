# odinform
 My take on the ODIN form project - the hard part was obviously getting my mind around the validation piece, but once I took a night to do it everything else was just the CSS rules and pushing and pulling pieces into shape.  Also learning how to install custom web fonts was good to learn.

 Hope you enjoy it~
